    <h1>Megan the Programmer</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Megan and I love working with computers. Though I have a degree in Chemistry, I wrote my thesis on the computer modeling of a reaction, <em>no physical chemicals involved!</em> I am hoping to expand my knowledge of Computer Programming, which has so far been limited to some very specialized programs. As such, I have already taken several classes in Python and Java, and am currently taking classes in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>I also have a deep interest in art and love creativity. I have experience working in HTML and CSS from a class in Web Design and I am excited to combine this experience with the JavaScript I am currently learning.</p>

    <p>Outside of messing about on computers, I also enjoy doing art, playing video games, and reading science-fiction and fantasy, especially the Diskworld novels of Terry Pratchett.</p>
